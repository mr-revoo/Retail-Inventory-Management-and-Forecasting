## Retail-Inventory-Management-and-Forecasting
--- 
### Overview
---
Managing inventory in retail can be a balancing act. Retailers need to meet customer demands while avoiding stockouts and overstocking, both of which can negatively impact profit and customer satisfaction. This project aims to develop a Retail Inventory Management and Forecasting System to streamline inventory tracking, monitor sales, and accurately forecast future stock requirements

The system leverages SQL databases and cloud services, such as Azure, to deliver real-time inventory visibility and demand forecasting, empowering retailers to make informed decisions.
